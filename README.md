Welcome to my ThreeJS 3D Developer Portfolio, a project where the beauty of 3D graphics and animations comes to life, showcasing my skills and projects in an interactive and immersive way. This portfolio is inspired by the most impressive websites in the world and serves as a testament to the power of ThreeJS coupled with the latest web development technologies.

üöÄ About the Project
This portfolio is built upon the foundations laid by the ThreeJS library, enhanced with React Three Fiber to create stunning 3D graphics within a React application. With the addition of TailwindCSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations, this portfolio stands as a vibrant, responsive, and user-friendly website that runs smoothly across all devices.

What I Learned
ThreeJS: Mastered the powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating 3D models.
React Three Fiber: Utilized this popular library to integrate ThreeJS into React applications seamlessly.
TailwindCSS: Applied the utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.
Framer Motion: Brought animations to the React website, enhancing user interaction and engagement.
Additionally, I delved into:

Loading, creating, and customizing 3D models and geometries with various lighting techniques.
Understanding the 3D world, including camera perspectives and object positioning.
Making the codebase reusable and scalable through Higher Order Components (HOCs) and best practices.
Implementing functionality for sending emails through a form on the website.
Ensuring site responsiveness and performance optimization using Suspense and Preload.

üåê Hosting
This portfolio is hosted with Netlify.

üåü Acknowledgments
